    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to maximize nonprofit organizations visibility, while allowing them to gather donations they need as quickly as possible. We want to eliminate shortage of items in shelters and centers that serve individuals in need, whether that is nonperishable food, clothing, or extra hands for an upcoming event. For our donors, we wanted to create a smooth and convenient way for them to give back and get involved. We eliminate the need for having to research each charity individually and the guessing game of what they may need the most.</p>

            <p >We offer a simple and efficient way for nonprofit organizations to update what donations they need the most. This eliminates the hassle of having to turn away certain donations that you may already have a sufficient amount of that another organization may be in need of.</p>

        <p>Donors are able to directly see an organization needs and can now easily divide their resources to give to the appropriate locations. Donors can view profiles to learn more about each org and contact them to arrange dropoffs or even offer themselves as a volunteer.</p>
